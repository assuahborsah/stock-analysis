Steve stock Analysis VBA
Overview Of Project

This project's purpose is to refactor Microsoft Excel VBA code in Module 2 solution to find out whether refactoring the code will make the VBA script run faster  for stock year 2017 and 2018. This will help determine which stock to invest in. 

Results

2017 - 0.4140625 seconds

2018 - 0.1640625 seconds

Difference - 0.25 seconds

Results shows that there was a decrease in elapsed run time between 2017 and 2018 by 0.25 seconds. 2018 run faster as compared to 2017.

2017 Elapsed Run Time

Summary

Refactoring process is more like editing a book in which software erosion and deterioration is prevented in a gradual process. Refactoring is cost effective in the sense that it does not prepare a completely new code structure but rather uses a number of methods such as extraction, encapsulation, and reformatting to optimize code, whiles at the same time keeping and maintaining the codes original functions. This process does not add new functions, but rather makes the code more efficient by taking fewer steps to execute, less memory used, and improving the logic of the code for future users.

A disadvantage of refactoring is that new bugs and errors could be introduced into the code.

Refactoring of the original VBA script let to a better quality code.
